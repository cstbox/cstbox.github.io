CSTBox v3 API documentation
===========================

The CSTBox v3 Python framework is composed of a collection of modules and sub-packages 
gathered into a global toplevel package named ''pycstbox''.

It is divided in two main areas :

    - the **core** area, containing all the components providing the mandatory services and 
      data structures
    - the **extension** area, gathering independant components providing complementary services. 
      Such extensions can add the support of protocols, device types,... or additional services, 
      such as adapters to exchange data with external systems, domain specific processing,...
